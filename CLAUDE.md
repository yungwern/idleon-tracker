# IdleOn Hub — Project Context

A React fan companion app for the idle game **IdleOn**. Reads a player's exported save file and displays character stats, talents, statues, shrines, minibosses, premium gear, and more in a clean dashboard UI.

---

## Stack & Environment

- **React + Vite** (Windows dev environment)
- **Plain CSS** per component — no CSS framework
- **HMR fix**: if hot reload stops working → `rmdir /s /q node_modules\.vite`
- **HMR rule**: one default export per `.jsx` file. All utilities/constants go in `.js` files.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/         # One folder per feature (see casing note below)
│   ├── Section pages:  Anvil, Breeding, Construction, Cooking, Farming, GearOptimizer,
│   │                   MasterClasses, Minibosses, Obols, Shrines, Statues, Worship
│   └── Shared/sub:     ActionBars, CharacterCard, CogBoardMap, ImportModal, InfoPanel,
│                       ObolBoard (in Obols/), PremiumGear, TalentsTab, TierList, TodoList
├── data/               # Game data; index.js barrel file re-exports everything, grouped by world
│                       # sections.js = sidebar sections; statueWorlds lives in statueMap.js
├── hooks/              # useSaveImport.js
├── lib/                # extractSnapshot.js — parses raw save JSON
├── styles/             # global.css — shared layout classes and reusable components
└── utils/              # appUtils.js (toClassSlug, classColor, statueLevelColor, shrineLevelColor)

public/images/          # Game sprites — Vite serves public/ at the site root, so code uses /images/...
IdleOn Resources/       # Outside src/ — save data copy + website-data.json
                        # website-data.json is a large game data mapping file from IdleOn Toolbox GitHub
                        # Reference for working out data mappings for new components
                        # Ask Eli to parse out the relevant section rather than loading the whole file
```

**File casing**: Windows doesn't care about filename case, but Linux/GitHub builds do — imports must
match the real filename exactly. Three components are lowercase on disk:
`Minibosses/minibosses.jsx|css`, `Shrines/shrines.jsx|css`, `Statues/statues.jsx|css`.
`Obols/ObolUtils.js` is PascalCase.

## Key Conventions
**General Formatting**: multi-line format - each property on its own line

**CSS naming**: namespace all classes with a component prefix to avoid conflicts
- e.g. `shrine-preview-*`, `statue-preview-*`, `miniboss-*`
- Shared layout classes and reusable components live in `global.css` — adding to global is preferred where it makes sense so future components can reuse them.
- Always use `global.css` if possible, especially for tooltips.

**CSS formatting**: multi-line format — each property on its own line

**CSS values**: `px` for sizing, hex codes for colors (e.g. `#c084fc`), class-based styling always — no inline styles

**Image paths**: images live in `public/images/`. In JS/JSX write them **without** a leading slash
(`images/mobs/Penguin.png`) so they work both locally and under the GitHub Pages subpath. In CSS write
them **with** one (`url("/images/...")`) so Vite can prefix the base path at build time. Filenames are
case-sensitive on the live site even though Windows ignores case.

**Deployment**: pushing to `main` deploys to https://yungwern.github.io/idleon-tracker/ via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. `vite.config.js` sets `base: '/idleon-tracker/'` for builds only.

**Adding new pages**: register the section in `data/sections.js` and wire up the component in `App.jsx`

**Data flow**: save file is parsed via `extractSnapshot.js` → stored in localStorage → loaded by `useSaveImport` hook → passed as props to components

**Characters come from the save**: names from `playerNames`, classes from `CharacterClass_N` (IDs mapped in
`data/classes.js`). Character count is whatever the save has, so never hard-code 10 or 11. `snapshot.characters[i]`
lines up with every `_i` save key. `data/characters.js` only holds starter to-dos keyed by character name;
class "best for" pills live in `CLASS_BEST_FOR` in `data/classes.js`.
